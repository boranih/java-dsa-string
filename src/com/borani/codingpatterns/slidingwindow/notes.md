This algorithmic technique is used when we need to handle the input data in a specific window size.Window Sliding Technique is a computational technique that aims to reduce the use of nested loops and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity.**How to use Sliding Window Technique?**The general use of the Sliding window technique can be demonstrated as follows:1. Find the size of the window required2. Compute the result for 1st window, i.e. from the start of the data structure3. Then use a loop to slide the window by 1, and keep computing the result window by window.**DS Involved:** Array, String, HashTable**To know, where we use the Sliding Window then we remember the following terms which is mentioned below:**Array, String, Sub Array, Sub String, Largest Sum, Maximum Sum, Minimum Sum**Sample Problems:**1. Longest Substring with 'K' Distinct Characters 2. Fruits into Baskets
